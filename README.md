# Snake

Snake is a 2D grid based AI game in which the AI agent finds a shortest path between a start and a goal position. There are two versions of this game, one with A* path planning algorithm and the other with Breadth First Search. The user interface of the game shows the number nodes visited by the agent to find the shortest path. Currently, the AI agent can find and traverse the shortest path between start and goal position but it doesnt grow in size after reaching goal position.
